# FormData

[![npm version][npm-image]][npm-url]

```bash
npm install formdata-polyfill
```

A FormData polyfill

This polyfill conditionally replace the native implementation rather then fixing the missing functions
since there is no way to get/delete something that you have appended already.
Therefore this also patches `xhr.prototype.send` and `fetch` to instead send the FormData as a blob

I was unable to patch Response/Request constructor
so if you are constructing them with a FormData you need to call `fd._blob()` manually.

```js
new Request(url, {
  method: 'post',
  body: fd._blob ? fd.blob() : fd
})
```

Dependencies

I do keep the internal data private to prevent unintentional access to them,
therefore `WeakMap` is used and you may need a polyfill for that also.

Updating from 2.x to 3.x
---

Previously you had to import the polyfill and use that,
since it didn't replace the global (existing) FormData.
But now it transparently calls `_blob()` for you when you are sending something with fetch or XHR.
This polyfill dose now monkey patch the `send` and `fetch` function.

So you maybe had something like this:

```javascript
var FormData = require('formdata-polyfill')
var fd = new FormData(form)
xhr.send(fd._blob())
```

But that is changed now, there is no module export any longer.
So you just have to do like you normal would:

```javascript
var fd = new FormData(form)
xhr.send(fd)
```

The status of the native FormData (2016-10-19) is:

This lib provides you all the function others don't include

 - `append` with filename
 - `delete()`, `get()`, `getAll()`, `has()`, `set()`
 - `entries()`, `keys()`, `values()`, and support of `for...of`
 - Available in web workers	(yes, just include it...)
